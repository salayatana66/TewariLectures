<p>Randomness has proven itself to be a useful resource for developing
provably efficient algorithms and protocols. As a result, the study  of randomized algorithms has become a major research topic in recent  years. This course will explore techniques for effectively using  randomization and for analyzing randomized algorithms, as well as
examples from a variety of settings and problem areas.</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Mathematical maturity; exposure to undergraduate material    in Algorithms, and in Discrete Probability and Combinatorics. If you
are not sure whether your background suffices, please see us.</p>

<p><b>Method of Evaluation: </b> Grading will be based on
	  (approximately bi-weekly) homework assignments, class
	  participation and a take-home final. As part    of
	  class participation, each student (possibly in teams) will
	  do a short project/presentation on a topic chosen in consultation
	  with the instructors.</p> 

<p><b>  Textbook: </b> 
<i>Randomized Algorithms</i>, Motwani and
   Raghavan.  Other very nice books in the area include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Probability and computing: randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis
</i>, Mitzenmacher and Upfal</li>
  <li><i>The Probabilistic Method</i>, Alon and Spencer</li>
  <li><i>Approximation Algorithms</i>, Vazirani</li>
</ul>
<p>    Material will be supplemented by handouts and papers.</p>
<p><b>Topics:</b>  A tentative list of topics includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic Concepts: basic inequalities, the probabilistic method</li>
  <li>Elementary applications: Hashing, fingerprinting, identity testing</li>
  <li>Random walks: cover times, Markov chains, resistive networks</li>
  <li>Large Deviations: Chernoff bounds, martingales, applications</li>
  <li>Derandomization and limited independence</li>
  <li>Applications of these techniques to algorithms, including
    approximation and online algorithms.</li>
</ul>
